### Purpose <br />
To load and transform a dataset using R.

### Article Overview <br />
Pollsters have been busy fielding surveys to measure concern levels since the first known case of COVID-19 was reported to the CDC back in January. Theyâ€™ve polled respondents on the government's handling of the infection, concern levels regarding the infection, and concern levels regarding the state of the economy.

### Overview of Approach <br />
So as to not get lost in the amount of data in the selected dataset, I will focus exclusively on concern levels (stemming from COVID) regarding the current state of the economy and see whether there are interesting findings therein ...

******

### Load the dataset <br />
Load the .csv from github (in its raw form) into dataframe variable ccdata (Covid concern data)

```{r}
ccdata <- read.csv("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Magnus-PS/CUNY-SPS-DATA-607/Assignment-1/covid_concern_polls.csv", header = TRUE, sep = ",")
```

### Transform the dataset <br />
Create subset of ccdata based on the 1st 10 columns and rename column headers to be more meaningful / indicative in the process

```{r}
new_ccdata <- data.frame(Pollster = ccdata$pollster[1:10], Date = ccdata$start_date[1:10], Number_of_Respondents = ccdata$sample_size[1:10], Question = ccdata$text[1:10], Percent_Very_Concerned = ccdata$very[1:10], Percent_Not_Concerned = ccdata$not_very[1:10])
```

### Plot the data - extra credit <br />
Create a simple plot / visual of the data set with clearly labelled axes.
```{r}
plot(new_ccdata$`Percent_Very_Concerned`,main="COVID Concern Levels", sub="Those very concerned regarding the current state of the economy", xlab="Poll #", ylab="Very Concerned (%)")
```

******

### Conclusions and Findings <br />
Based on the selected data, 57.8% of respondents are very concerned regarding the current state of the economy while only 6.8% are not concerned. Thus,  the economy is very likely to be a MAJOR point of discussion in the upcoming election. If I were to update the article on fivethirtyeight.com I would highlight this finding.
